# Netlify _redirects for SPA routing
# 
# The fix: Use "200" with explicit static file checks.
# Netlify processes redirects AFTER checking for static assets.
# If robots.txt exists in dist/, it should serve before this kicks in.
#
# If that still fails, the nuclear option is using Netlify Edge Functions,
# but let's try the simple approach first.
#
# Also: Remove any conflicting netlify.toml redirect rules!
