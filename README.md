## Components

### Navbar (`src/components/Navbar.tsx`)

The `Navbar` component handles the site's primary navigation, adapting its layout for desktop and mobile views.

**Recent Changes (July 26, 2025):**
- **Desktop Layout Fixes:** The desktop navigation now includes a conditional visual divider between section-specific navigation items (e.g., "Platform", "API") and always-present page navigation links (e.g., "App", "API", "Blog", "Feedback", "Waitlist").
- **Link Duplication Removed:** A duplicate "Blog" link in the desktop navigation was removed to streamline the user experience.
- **Navigation Order Adjustment:** The order of "Blog" and "Feedback" links in the desktop navigation has been adjusted for consistency.
