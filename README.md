# Dytto Site

This repository contains the Dytto marketing and developer site.

## Project Setup

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-org/dytto-site.git
    cd dytto-site
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    The site will be accessible at `http://localhost:5173` (or another port if 5173 is in use).

## Blog Page Functionality

The blog page (`/blog`) is designed to work even without a full Supabase backend configuration.

-   **Demo Mode:** If the `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` environment variable is not set, the blog page will automatically display a set of sample blog posts. This allows for local development and demonstration of the blog's UI and features without requiring a live Supabase instance. A "Demo mode" notice will be displayed on the page.

-   **Full Functionality:** To enable full blog functionality, including dynamic content fetching and API updates, you need to configure your Supabase project and set the `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` and `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` environment variables. Refer to the Supabase documentation for detailed setup instructions.
