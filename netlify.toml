# Netlify configuration for Dytto landing site

[build]

# IMPORTANT: No redirects needed for static files!
# Netlify serves static files from dist/ before processing redirects.
# The issue was the wildcard /* with force=false still overriding.
# 
# Solution: Use a more specific wildcard that excludes static files,
# OR rely on Netlify's default behavior with no explicit redirect.
# 
# Actually, the simplest fix is NO wildcard at all - use _redirects
# file with proper ordering, since netlify.toml wildcards can be buggy.
